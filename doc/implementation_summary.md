# QUBO Mapping Implementation Summary

We've successfully added QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) mapping functionality to the Python translation of the UnitDiskMapping.jl package. This implementation allows users to map QUBO problems to unit disk graphs, which can then be solved using quantum computing approaches.

## Added Functionality

We've implemented the following main functions:

1. `map_qubo(J, h)` - Maps a general QUBO problem to a unit disk graph
2. `map_simple_wmis(graph, weights)` - Maps a weighted MIS problem to a unit disk graph
3. `map_qubo_restricted(coupling)` - Maps a restricted QUBO problem with neighbor interactions to a unit disk graph
4. `map_qubo_square(coupling, onsite)` - Maps a QUBO problem on a square lattice to a unit disk graph

All these functions are based on the original Julia implementation in `dragondrop.jl`, translated to Python while maintaining the core algorithm and principles.

## Key Components

1. **CrossingLattice** - A data structure that represents a lattice of crossing lines, where each vertex in the original problem is represented by a line.

2. **Block** - Represents connections and crossings in the lattice.

3. **CopyLine** - Represents a T-shaped path in the grid for each vertex in the original graph.

4. **Gadgets** - Special structures for handling QUBO problems:
   - `gadget_qubo_restricted` for nearest-neighbor QUBO problems
   - `gadget_qubo_square` for QUBO problems on square lattices

5. **Result Classes** - Classes to hold the results of mapping operations:
   - `QUBOResult`
   - `WMISResult`
   - `RestrictedQUBOResult`
   - `SquareQUBOResult`

## Implementation Details

- The QUBO mapping utilizes the crossing lattice concept, where problems are mapped to a lattice with gadgets at crossing points.
- The implementation follows the theoretical approach described in the paper attached to the project.
- We've made simplifications where appropriate to make the code more readable and maintainable in Python.
- The implementation is tested with unit tests that ensure proper functioning of the main features.

## Usage Example

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
from unit_disk_mapping import map_qubo, map_config_back

# Create a QUBO problem
n = 4  # number of variables
J = np.zeros((n, n))
for i in range(n-1):
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        J[i, j] = np.random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1)
J = J + J.T  # Make symmetric
h = np.random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1, n)

# Map to unit disk graph
result = map_qubo(J, h)

# Get information about the mapping
print(f"Mapped to unit disk graph with {len(result.grid_graph.nodes)} nodes")

# After solving the maximum independent set problem on the grid graph,
# map the configuration back to the original problem
config = ...  # obtained from MIS solver
original_config = map_config_back(result, config)
```

## Future Improvements

1. Optimization of the algorithm for better performance
2. More comprehensive testing on large QUBO instances
3. Integration with quantum computing libraries for solving the mapped problems
4. Visualization tools for the mapping results

This implementation completes the QUBO mapping functionality of the UnitDiskMapping package, providing users with a valuable tool for quantum computing applications.
