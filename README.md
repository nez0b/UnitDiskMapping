# Unit Disk Mapping (Python)

A Python implementation of the Unit Disk Mapping algorithm for mapping optimization problems to unit disk graphs for quantum computing.

## Overview

This package implements algorithms for mapping various optimization problems (like Maximum Independent Set, QUBO, and integer factorization) to unit disk grid graphs, which can be naturally encoded in neutral-atom quantum computers.

The original implementation is in Julia and can be found at [UnitDiskMapping.jl](https://github.com/QuEraComputing/UnitDiskMapping.jl).

## Installation

This package requires:
- Python 3.7+
- NetworkX
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

```bash
# Not yet available on PyPI
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of mapping a graph to a unit disk graph:

```python
import networkx as nx
from src.unit_disk_mapping import map_graph, MinhThiTrick

# Create a graph
graph = nx.petersen_graph()

# Map the graph to a unit disk grid graph
result = map_graph(graph, vertex_order=MinhThiTrick())

# Access the mapped graph
grid_graph = result.grid_graph

# Convert to a NetworkX graph
nx_graph = grid_graph.to_networkx()
```

## Example Scripts

The package includes example scripts to demonstrate usage:

```bash
# Run a basic example
python examples/example.py

# Run a specific example for 5-vertex graphs
python examples/example_5vertex.py
```

This example produces visualizations showing both the original graph and its unit disk mapping in the img/ directory.

## Testing

To run tests:

```bash
python run_tests.py
```

## Features

- Map arbitrary graphs to unit disk graphs
- Support for both weighted and unweighted problems
- Path decomposition algorithms for optimizing the mapping
- Utilities for working with and visualizing unit disk graphs
- Gadget patterns for handling graph crossings
- Advanced weighted mapping functionality

## Implementation Notes

This Python implementation is a translation of the original Julia code. The core functionality is implemented with additional features for gadget application and weighted mappings.
